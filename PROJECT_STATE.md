## THE NORTH-STAR

**~80% prediction accuracy on WOLF — but only under an honest, narrow contract.**

80% is *not* achievable on "WOLF goes up tomorrow" (that's ≤55% for the best funds
alive). It is achievable on a conditional, selective question: *given a
high-conviction setup, will WOLF move in direction D before stop S over horizon
H, with N≥30 samples/year?* The system is built for **selective prediction** —
it stays silent most of the time and only fires when the gates agree.
**Silence is the product, not a bug.**

The full vision is the "WOLFSPEED-Only Prediction Engine" blueprint (7 specialist
models → meta-model, 12 data categories, regime detection, options flow, etc.).
Today we have the *bones*: one model, one ticker, a confidence gate, a calibration
path, and (as of PR #30) the credibility ledger. The path forward is disciplined
additions, gated by **data accumulation** — see "Honesty layer" below.

### Honesty layer (pre-registered, do not move the goalposts)

- WOLF is **post-Chapter-11** (new shares 2025-09-29) → only ~250 trading days of
  the security that actually exists. Pre-bankruptcy WOLF is a *different
  instrument* — never train on it as if continuous.
- The 80% claim is judged only after enough resolved high-conviction picks
  accumulate. Until then the journal reads **insufficient_samples** by design.
- **Kill condition** (`core/prediction.py → FALSIFICATION_THRESHOLD`): once N≥30
  resolved high-conviction picks, if win rate < 70% **and** the 95% CI excludes
  80%, the 80% claim is **abandoned** and the system repositions as a
  lower-confidence directional aid. Surfaced at `verdict.falsification` on
  `/api/wolf/pick-journal`.

**Sandbox cannot reach Railway** (egress allowlist) — all production verification
is done by the user. Agents must not claim prod-verified without user confirmation.

### Live env config (set in Railway, confirmed by user)
- `OBJECTIVE_MODE=aggressive`
- `OBJECTIVE_AUTO_MODE_ENABLED=0` (env wins; runtime auto-mode override disabled)
- `MIN_ALERT_CONFIDENCE=0.75`

## HOW PICKS ARE GENERATED (v3.2 engine)

**XGBoost is BACK.** The old "win-rate-from-gpo, no XGBoost" design is gone. The
live engine is the **v3.2 XGBoost model** trained on TP/SL daily-bar outcomes with
walk-forward validation. The WOLF model trained at **~65.4% holdout accuracy**
(PR #21 was the fix that finally produced folds — see Change Log).

`core/signal_engine.py → predict_live_ex(symbol, asset_type, scores=None)`:
1. Load model; fetch intraday OHLCV (5d/1h).
2. **Regime gates** (inside the engine): skip BUY if below EMA200 + ADX<20
   (downtrend + chop); skip if full bearish EMA stack and not oversold.
3. Model `predict_proba` → `up_prob`.
4. **Meta gates**: reject if `edge < V3_MIN_EDGE`, holdout `accuracy < V3_MIN_HOLDOUT_ACC`,
   or walk-forward acc/edge below floors.
5. Confidence: `conf = clamp(accuracy + (up_prob − min_p) × 4.0, 0.75, 0.95)`
   where `accuracy ≈ 0.654` (model holdout) and `min_p = V3_MIN_WIN_PROBA` (0.55).
6. If `scores` dict is passed, it's populated with the **specialist score vector
   + regime-at-issuance** (PR #30) for the pick journal.

### The four-gate chain (why the system is usually silent)
1. **Model gate** — engine emits a signal at all (regime + meta gates above).
2. **Confidence floor** — `MIN_ALERT_CONFIDENCE` (`CONFIDENCE_FLOOR`, 0.75 live).
3. **SELL block** — BUY-only. DOWN signals blocked (1.9% historical WR).
4. **Objective gate** — `core/prediction.py → _objective_gate`.

### Objective gate modes
| Mode | target_wr | min_samples | bootstrap_min_conf |
|---|---|---|---|
| precision | 0.80 | 20 | 0.90 |
| balanced | 0.70 | 12 | 0.85 |
| **aggressive (live)** | 0.62 | 8 | 0.78 |

`OBJECTIVE_AUTO_MODE_ENABLED=1` lets the engine override `OBJECTIVE_MODE` via
`ghost_state.objective_mode_runtime`. We currently run with auto-mode **off** so
the env value is authoritative. Inspect live gating at `/api/wolf/gate-status`.

## DATA FEED CHAIN

`core/signal_engine.py → _fetch_ohlcv` tries, in order:
**Alpaca SIP → Alpaca IEX → Polygon → yfinance → Stooq** (5-tier, PR #9/#12/#17).
Health probe uses `HEALTH_PROBE_SYMBOL` (AAPL, not WOLF) so feed health isn't
conflated with WOLF data gaps (PR #24).

**Known feed-data limits (NOT code bugs):** Key Stats, Analyst targets, Short
Interest often return empty for this account tier (yfinance/Polygon). Fixing
these needs a **paid provider decision** (Finnhub paid / Tiingo / Alpha Vantage),
not more code.

## DATABASE — KEY TABLES

| Table | Notes |
|---|---|
| `predictions` | v1 + v2/v3 picks. **v3.2 era = `id >= 223438`** (used everywhere to exclude ~223k legacy rows). Columns incl. `outcome`, `exit_price`, `pnl_pct`, `resolved_at`, `features JSONB`, **`scores JSONB`** (PR #30) |
| `ghost_state` | key/val cross-cycle state (objective_mode_runtime, gate_outcome_history, v32_stats_start_ts, last_train_details, etc.) |
| `ghost_prediction_outcomes` | legacy v1 signal source — no longer the engine |
| `ghost_v3_model` | trained v3 model blob + meta_* rows |

`core/db.py` migrations are additive/`IF NOT EXISTS` and non-destructive. The
`scores JSONB` column is added on boot.

**CRITICAL:** when INSERTing v2/v3 predictions, set `run_at = predicted_at` (v1
schema had NOT NULL on run_at; migration drops it but it may return).

## ADMIN AUTH (PR #28)

HTTP Basic Auth (PR #23) returned a correct 401 locally but **blank-paged on
Railway** (edge/browser mishandling the Basic challenge). Replaced with
**HMAC-signed cookie login**: JSON-body `POST /admin/login` mints an HttpOnly,
SameSite=Lax, Secure (`ADMIN_COOKIE_SECURE`, default on) token. Do not reintroduce
HTTP Basic.

---

## COCKPIT UI

- **Investor cockpit:** `cockpit.html` at `GET /cockpit`. Modules incl. hero,
  perf strip, prediction chart, stats, earnings, analyst, news, short interest,
  catalysts, portfolio, **Pick Journal (blueprint module 7)** (PR #30), Truth Mode.
- **Operator console:** `admin.html` at `GET /admin` (cookie-gated).
- Cockpit JS uses v2 field names: `outcome` (not status), `stop_price` (not
  stop_loss), `expires_at` (unix). Calculate gain as `(target-entry)/entry*100`.

## CACHE-BUSTING RAILWAY (recurring pain)

Railway/Nixpacks has served stale containers repeatedly. Bust the cache by bumping
ALL of: `Procfile` boot-echo string, `nixpacks.toml` `cache_bust` comment, and the
`wolf_app.py` boot banner / `_RUNNING_PR_VERSION`. Verify deploy via `/api/_version`.

---

## WHAT FAILED — DO NOT REPEAT

- **(SUPERSEDED) "XGBoost removed."** The 2026-03 note said XGBoost overfit on
  skewed gpo data and was removed. The v3.2 engine (PR #10/#21) retrains on **TP/SL
  daily-bar labels with walk-forward validation + holdout gates**, which is a
  different setup — it is now the live engine at ~65.4%. The old caution (don't
  train on bear-skewed gpo direction labels) still stands; the blanket "no XGBoost"
  does not.
- **Walk-forward produced 0 folds** — hardcoded `min_train=max(120, n*0.5)` with
  n≈127 → 0 folds → no model. Fixed PR #21 by making floors env-tunable
  (`V3_WF_MIN_TRAIN` default 60, `V3_WF_TEST_SIZE` default 15). **This trained the model.**
- **News leak (Zoom/IBM/Ralph Lauren)** — Finnhub tags every WOLF-query article
  `["WOLF"]`, so the `WOLF in syms` shortcut passed everything. Fixed PR #26 by
  requiring a textual mention (WOLFSPEED/WOLF/SiC/silicon carbide).
- **/admin blank page** — HTTP Basic Auth on Railway. Fixed with cookie login (PR #28).
- **Pushing fixes to an already-merged branch** — always branch fresh from `main`.
- **Reuters RSS / morning_card 3600 / HOOD-COIN / crypto defaults** — see history;
  still applies.

## NOT YET BUILT (blueprint backlog, dependency-ordered)

- [ ] **Accumulate ~30+ resolved high-conviction picks** so the falsification gate
      can be honestly evaluated (cold-start; gates everything below).
- [ ] **Regime detector (HMM)** — Squeeze/Trend-up/Trend-down/Chop/Capitulation.
      Deferred per honesty layer: ~250 days is too thin for a 5-state HMM, and it
      adds a *new* silencing gate to an engine that barely fires. Build after the
      journal shows where losses cluster.
- [ ] Options-flow model (Polygon) — put/call, IV skew, GEX. **Validate WOLF
      options depth first** before assuming mega-cap GEX techniques transfer.
- [ ] Sentiment model (FinBERT) on the existing news pipeline.
- [ ] Feature-drift monitoring (KL divergence).
- [ ] Paid data provider for Key Stats / Analyst / Short Interest (budget decision).
- [ ] Regime-conditional calibration (separate isotonic maps per regime) — the
      journal already captures regime-at-issuance to enable this.
