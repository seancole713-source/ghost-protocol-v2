PROJECT_STATE.py — Ghost Protocol v2
Single source of truth. Accountability ledger. Read this before touching anything.

RULES:
  1. Read this file before starting work.
  2. Verify claimed fixes on the LIVE site before trusting them.
  3. After every fix session, add a dated section with PR numbers + live verification.
  4. Never mark [x] done unless YOU personally verified it on the live dashboard.
  5. If you find new bugs, add them to the TODO list.
  6. This is not documentation. It is an accountability ledger.
     Agents lie. This file exists because of that.

FAILURES = """
1. (SUPERSEDED) "XGBoost removed"
   2026-03 note: XGBoost on ghost_prediction_outcomes hit 86% val by overfitting
   bear-skewed DOWN labels; it was removed in favor of per-symbol win rate.
   STATUS NOW: the v3.2 engine (PR #10/#21) retrains on TP/SL daily-bar labels with
   walk-forward validation + holdout gates — a different setup — and IS the live
   engine at ~65.4%. The narrow caution (don't train on bear-skewed gpo direction)
   still holds; the blanket "no XGBoost" does not.

2. Walk-forward produced 0 folds
   Hardcoded min_train = max(120, n*0.50) with n~127 -> 0 folds -> no model.
   Fix (PR #21): env-tunable floors V3_WF_MIN_TRAIN (60), V3_WF_TEST_SIZE (15).
   THIS is the change that finally trained the WOLF model.

3. News leak (Zoom / IBM / Ralph Lauren)
   Finnhub tags every WOLF-query article ["WOLF"], so the `WOLF in syms` shortcut
   passed everything. Fix (PR #26): require textual mention (WOLFSPEED/WOLF/SiC/
   silicon carbide). Also fixed an unfiltered yfinance augmentation loop.

4. /admin blank page
   HTTP Basic Auth (PR #23) returned correct 401 locally but blank-paged on Railway
   (edge/browser mishandling the Basic challenge). Fix (PR #28): HMAC cookie login,
   JSON body (no python-multipart). Do not reintroduce HTTP Basic.

5. Railway serving stale containers (recurring)
   Bust cache by bumping ALL of: Procfile boot-echo, nixpacks cache_bust comment,
   wolf_app boot banner / _RUNNING_PR_VERSION. Verify via /api/_version.

6. Pushing fixes to an already-merged branch
   Created a commit on a stale merged branch. Always branch fresh from main.

7. (historical) Reuters RSS blocked on Railway; morning_card interval 3600 spam;
   HOOD/COIN poison; crypto defaults; confidence as features[0]. Still applies.

8. Agents claiming fixes done without live verification
   This file exists because of that. Verify before marking [x].

SESSION_LOG = """
--- 2026-06-28–29 | PR #82–#90 — Super Ghost foundation, unified console, live coverage gate ---
Context: User clarified Ghost is a prediction-market/intelligence product, not an
auto-trading/broker bot. Mission: build toward the strongest possible stock prediction
platform while staying honest — no guaranteed profit, no fake accuracy, no fake data.

Phase 1 — Super Ghost intelligence layer (PR #82–#83):
  - Added market-regime detection and conviction adjustment (SPX/Nasdaq/sector/VIX/Fed/CPI context)
  - Added optional real AI brief on /api/wolf/super-ghost?ai=1 using Ghost's Anthropic integration
  - Fixed model default to the proven Ghost Ask model: claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
  - Live verified ai_brief.available=true after PR #83

Phase 2 — Prediction Truth Ledger (PR #84):
  - Added core/super_ghost_ledger.py and super_ghost_predictions table
  - Routes: log, history, accuracy, if-followed, resolve
  - Hourly resolver job added; resolve is auth-gated
  - Purpose: every prediction can be judged later; wins include correct DOWN calls, not only UP calls

Phase 3 — Max Build roadmap (PR #85):
  - Added docs/SUPER_GHOST_MASTER_BUILD.md
  - Added docs/super_ghost_master_plan.json (98 requirements, 11 phases)
  - Added tests/test_master_plan.py so the plan itself is CI-enforced
  - Next true accuracy phase identified: P1 Data Coverage Upgrade

Phase 4 — Unified Liquid Glass prediction console (PR #86–#87):
  - / and /picks now serve ghost_console.html, the unified prediction console
  - Preserved /legacy-picks and /cockpit
  - Sidebar tabs: Overview, Top stocks, Bullish, Today, 48 hour, This week, Live mirror, Health
  - Local prediction pool controls; Top Picks gated by truth-ledger win rate
  - Added GET /api/market/session/{symbol} for live open/high/low/price mirror

Phase 5 — Data Coverage Upgrade + hard trust gate (PR #88–#90):
  Root cause: live Super Ghost coverage was 7/25 because _fetch_live_snapshot sourced
  price history + fundamentals from yfinance. Yahoo blocks Railway IPs, starving the
  existing scorers. The scorers were not the problem; the live data path was.

  - PR #88:
    * core/market_history.py added
    * core/sec_fundamentals.py added
    * EPS YoY + revenue YoY via SEC XBRL
    * current-price fallback via existing 5-tier spot chain
    * hard gate MIN_COVERAGE_FOR_AB=18: no A/B grade and no HIGH-CONVICTION below 18/25
    * GET /api/wolf/super-ghost/coverage added
  - PR #89:
    * get_daily_history() now delegates first to production-proven _fetch_ohlcv chain:
      Alpaca SIP -> IEX -> Polygon -> yfinance -> Stooq
  - PR #90:
    * Generic ticker->CIK support for SEC fundamentals; common large-cap built-in map
      and best-effort SEC ticker index

  - AAPL: 19/25, meets_ab_gate=true
  - NVDA: 20/25, meets_ab_gate=true
  - Deployed report carries coverage.min_for_ab_grade=18 and meets_ab_gate metadata
  - Invariant verified: if coverage <18, no A+/A/B+/B grade and no HIGH-CONVICTION

Tests:
  - make test: 503 passed, 3 deselected/skipped, 2 warnings
  - make test-compile: exit 0
  - Focused suite: 34 passed (coverage gate, Super Ghost, master plan)

Important honesty note:
  WOLF meeting coverage gate does NOT mean "buy" or "high confidence." Live output
  can still be grade F / NO EDGE — WATCH ONLY if the evidence is weak. That is correct.
  Coverage is a prerequisite for trust, not a promise of profit.

PR #100 Point-in-Time Feature Store shipped after the evolution directive:
  - Every logged Super Ghost prediction now gets an immutable feature snapshot.
  - Timestamp audit flags any source data dated after the prediction time.
  - This prevents future leakage in learning/lab/model-training work.

PR #99 Promotion Gate shipped after the evolution directive:
  - Ghost can now decide PROMOTE / KEEP CHAMPION / KEEP SHADOWING / RETIRE / INSUFFICIENT using strict evidence gates.
  - No auto-promotion; this creates auditable review records only.

PR #98 Shadow Model Runner shipped after the evolution directive:
  - Seven specialist prediction brains now run in parallel with production Ghost when predictions are logged.
  - Shadow predictions are stored and later resolved against parent Truth Ledger outcomes.
  - This creates true model disagreement memory for future promotion gates.

PR #96 Feature Attribution Memory shipped after the evolution directive:
  - Every logged Super Ghost checklist point is now feature-attribution memory.
  - Resolved outcomes classify features as helped/hurt/underweighted/noise/missing.
  - Feature reliability profiles create long-term memory of which evidence mattered.

PR #95 Champion/Challenger Lab shipped after the evolution directive:
  - Production Ghost now competes against shadow challenger policies on resolved ledger rows.
  - Results are persisted in super_ghost_lab_runs/results.
  - Conservative gates prevent any recommendation without enough rows/actionable calls/improvement.
  - No auto-promotion and no trading; this creates evidence only.

PR #93 Learning Brain shipped after the evolution directive:
  - Every resolved Super Ghost prediction can become a learning event.
  - If Ghost predicts a target too low/high (e.g. $5 -> $7), it records the mistake type and lesson.
  - Learning profiles can apply bounded future confidence/conviction/target adjustments after enough samples.
  - Learning is visible via /api/wolf/super-ghost/learning and the console Health row.

PR #91 follow-up polish shipped after the review:
  - Added persistent post-falsification banner outside Health.
  - Replaced "resolved sample" jargon with "completed predictions" copy.
  - Hid duplicate top-tab chrome; sidebar nav is the single visible nav source.
  - Deployed as sha 3a83893, _pr_version 91; 504 tests passing.

Remaining P1 work:
  - Form 4 insider parser
  - 13F institutional parser
  - analyst revisions / target-change feed
  - options chain / unusual activity
  - macro event calendar + CPI/Fed surprise classifier
  - guidance/news event classifier + dedup
  - server-persisted prediction pool + richer chart overlays

--- 2026-06-25–26 | PR #70–#81 — Comprehensive security + reliability audit (12 PRs) ---
Context: User asked "is ghost working perfect now can i trust the predictions?"
This triggered a multi-phase audit spanning 2 days, 12 PRs, and 3 external agent
audit passes. All 13 original findings + 10 continuation findings resolved.

Phase 1 — Production incident response (PR #70–#76, 2026-06-25):
  - yfinance JSON parse errors on EVERY symbol (Yahoo blocking Railway IPs)
  - Alpaca rate-limit storm (45 calls/60s, limit 30)
  - Circuit breaker infinite half-open probe loop — breakers logged "OPEN" but never blocked
  - API rate limiter 120→300 RPM (cockpit ~25 parallel calls on load)
  - All raw yfinance calls gated behind _yfinance_cb across 6 modules
  - Watchlist-membership filter on REAL_TRADE_WHERE + write-side guard
  - Confidence gates restored: MIN_ALERT_CONFIDENCE 0.55→0.75, OBJECTIVE_BOOTSTRAP_MIN_CONF 0.6→0.78
  - RDFN removed from STOCK_SYMBOLS

Phase 2 — External agent audit (PR #77–#78, 2026-06-26):
  Agent ran deep read-only audit against ed541c4. Found 13 findings (F01–F13).
  All fixed: unauth portfolio routes, raw yfinance bypasses, sentiment floor bypass,
  public test-alert, CRON_SECRET fail-open, double delay, 5-tier spot chain,
  degraded mode, scheduler overlap, XFF hardening, Playwright, breaker tests,
  wolf_price alias.

Phase 3 — Continuation audit (PR #79, 2026-06-26):
  Agent continued audit. Found 5 more findings (C01–C05). C01 was false alarm
  (dirty working tree). Fixed: NaN sanitization in Polygon/Stooq, Telegram dedup
  conditional on _send(), dead-letter admin UI, OAuth CIMD SSRF hardening.

Phase 4 — Third-pass audit (PR #80, 2026-06-26):
  Agent ran third pass. Found 10 findings (GP-A01–GP-A10). Fixed 9: Ghost Ask
  portfolio leak, Polygon/Stooq NaN, check_feeds 5-tier, Playwright hidden element,
  cockpit 401 handling, reconcile double-resolve, train endpoint lock, morning card
  dedup after send, OAuth redirects. GP-A03 deferred to PR #81.

Phase 5 — GP-A03 + War Room (PR #81, 2026-06-26):
  - yfinance wrapper (core/yfinance_client.py) + api/wolf_endpoints.py monkeypatch
  - Zero raw yfinance calls remain in the codebase
  - War Room endpoint (POST /api/wolf/war-room) — 6-agent equity research pipeline

Final state: 426 tests passing, 3 skipped, 2 warnings. Clean working tree.
All 23 audit findings resolved across 12 PRs.

--- 2026-06-10 | Phase 1+2 blueprint + squeeze radar + post-falsification contract ---
Context: operator chose "Phase 1 + Phase 2" (not product-only). Falsification gate
already tripped (~28% WR, CI excludes 80%). Goal: honest repositioning, wire blueprint
probes, keep squeeze radar production-ready for next CT session.

Two lanes (independent):
  v3 picks     — ~3-day gated XGBoost holds; silent when regime/objective gates bind
  squeeze radar — intraday RVOL + move; 3 AM–7 PM CT; separate Telegram path

Shipped squeeze lane (commits d7477d1 .. c0bad2e, _pr_version 55–59):
  d7477d1 — squeeze scorecard (Setup/Trigger/Confirm), CT radar, probability targets
  d17ffe3 — overnight panel honest copy; persist data/squeeze_last_scan.json
  3d9f4b9 — cockpit lane labels (Today's v3 pick vs intraday squeeze)

  - HMM regime detector still deferred (~250 trading days too thin)
  - Paid feed for Key Stats / Analyst / Short Interest

--- 2026-06-07 | Open pick review (change mind mid-trade) ---
Context: operator wanted Ghost always tracking — withdraw or refresh when live scans
no longer support an open pick (not locked until expiry).

Shipped:
  - core/pick_review.py — review_open_picks each cycle before save
  - Outcome WITHDRAWN (mark-to-market P&L, not WIN/LOSS)
  - Withdraw on: regime gate, prob_low, meta gate, confidence floor, supersede on

  - Ghost Ask + cockpit WITHDRAWN styling

--- 2026-06-07 | Pre-market watchlist scans ---
Context: operator asked Ghost to include pre-market (previously scans skipped 4:00-9:30 AM CT).

Shipped:
  - GHOST_PREMARKET_SCAN=1 (default): run_prediction_cycle scans full watchlist pre-open
  - Market scan cadence: 30m interval during pre-market when enabled
  - core/prices.get_extended_session: prior close, session price, gap_pct
  - predict_live_ex: overlays extended-hours price on last daily bar; scores.extended_session
  - GHOST_PREMARKET_FLOOR_BUMP=0.03 extra confidence required pre-open
  - Ghost Ask + cockpit copy updated for pre/after-hours sessions
  - tests/test_premarket_scan.py

--- 2026-06-07 | Full watchlist coverage + daily forecast panel + training reliability ---
Context: operator wanted all 44 watchlist symbols trained, cockpit panel reorder, and
daily prediction UI. Root training failure was batch OHLCV fetch returning empty under
Alpaca rate limits (14 symbols showed n_samples=0 despite 126+ samples on retry).

Shipped (commits c088b05 .. 8ba8143):
  - Backend performance log (ghost_perf_cycles/symbol_evals/events) + cockpit panel
  - Daily Prediction Panel (next session predict row + last session market row)
  - Cockpit: Ask Ghost, WOLF play, Prediction vs Reality moved below My Portfolio
  - Training: OHLCV retry/cache/2y default, inter-symbol delay, watchlist peer pool,
    adaptive WF floors for thin tickers (STUB), relaxed Railway gates
  - Fixed Railway STOCK_SYMBOLS (was TSLA,META,AMZN,T -> official 44 list)
  - RDFN daily forecast: scorecard no longer hardcodes 3mo; uses 2y fallback + stale flag
    (RDFN delisted ~2025-06-30 after Rocket acquisition)

  - Use POST /api/v3/train?force=true (async) for full retrains; /api/v3/train/sync
    502s on Railway proxy timeout

Open / deferred:
  - News manual import: already live at /admin; wait on bulk use — Finnhub auto-cycle OK
  - Relaxed V3 gates trade quality for coverage on edge-case symbols; monitor pick journal
  - RDFN and other delisted names: forecasts show stale last-trade data only

  #30 pick journal — credibility ledger (audit trail + expectancy/Brier + kill condition)

Root cause that unblocked everything: walk-forward made 0 folds on ~127 rows
because of a hardcoded 120-row training floor. PR #21 made the floors env-tunable.

Diagnosed (research, no code): WATCHING-mode root cause = four-gate chain where the
objective gate in precision mode needs either 80% historical WR (model is 65%,
impossible) or 0.90 per-pick bootstrap confidence (a 65% model rarely produces
up_prob high enough). User switched to aggressive mode (env above).

User-verified on prod 2026-05-23:
  - /api/wolf/gate-status: mode=aggressive, auto_mode_enabled=false, floor=0.75
  - /admin: clean cookie-login console (no blank page)
  - /api/wolf/pick-journal: 1 resolved pick (Mar 27, WOLF UP 91% conf, LOSS -1.36%);
    win_rate 0.0 [0-79 CI], expectancy -1.36%, Brier 0.819, verdict insufficient_samples
  - Cockpit Pick Journal card: "GATHERING EVIDENCE - Need 30 ... Have 1."

Open / not yet done:
  - Cold start: only 1 resolved high-conviction pick. Need ~30 before the
    falsification gate can judge the 80% claim. Silence is by design.
  - Key Stats / Analyst / Short Interest still empty (feed-tier limit; needs paid provider).
  - Regime detector (HMM) deferred until the journal has data (data too thin now).
